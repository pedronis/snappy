summary: Ensure that mounts persist during a refresh of a content snap

details: |
  A bug in snap-update-ns due to the experimental robust-mount-namespaces option
  being enabled resulted in all files being shared by content interfaces disappearing
  during a refresh, either of snapd or of the snap sharing files via a content. The
  most visible example of this was the firefox snap, which would crash when the files
  disappeared like this (other snaps would misbehave but would not crash as fatally as
  the firefox snap). See launchpad bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1945697 for
  full details.
  Check that contents is present as expected as prerequisites, and that
  it might get partially updated if nedeed.

  - -ubuntu-14.04-* # no support for tests.session
  - -ubuntu-core-* # can't modify rootfs to add a fonts dir
